Bowling Challenge.
</h1>


 Week 5 challenge at Makers was to write an algorithm
 to calculate bowling score. After getting to a good stage 
 in the challenge , I decided to try and also solve it in python
 in the Makers way (TDD). [Here](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/bowling-challenge) is the JS solution for this challenge.

To use Application.
</h4>

- ``Fork and clone`` this repo.
- You need a ``virtual env``. Find more **[here](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)**
- Once your virtual env is sorted pip ``virtualenv -p python3 envname``.
- Activate your envname.
- pip install pytest.
- Once all dpendencies have been installed cd in ``BowllingChallenge``.
- ``run pytest`` to run test.
